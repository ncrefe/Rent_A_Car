UML CLASS DIAGRAM: 
	Blue arrow : Inheritance Generalization
	Green arrow : Interface Realization
	Whole diamond : Composition
	Dashed line arrow : Dependency

	We put the symbolic meanings for headers of Enumeration,Class and Interface with a photo.
	There is two diagram one them shows simpler relations, other one shows associations and its the main graph for us. 

SEQUENCE DIAGRAM: 
	In the assignment we have a "totalPrice" method that calculates the types of both customers. We made two different "sequence diagrams" for this. 
	One of them has "private" methods, the other does not. 
	We also have a method that calculates only the "commercial customer" price you want. It also has a version with "private" methods, the other does not.
	
	Operations repeated 3 times are included in the diagram because since there are three different possibilities, 
	these operations are performed for each of them(Platinum,Gold,Silver).

STATE DIAGRAM:
	Initial and final state represent start and end of the process.
